## Troubleshooting

### Testimonials Not Appearing

1. Check if testimonials are marked as "Active"
2. Verify testimonials are published (not just saved as draft)
3. Ensure at least one testimonial exists

### Photo Issues

1. Check image format (JPG/PNG supported)
2. Verify image size (minimum 400x400px)
3. Ensure alt text is provided for accessibility

### Display Order Issues

1. Use "Display Order" field (lower numbers = first)
2. Check that multiple testimonials don't have same order number
3. Save and republish after order changes

## Best Practices

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer high-quality testimonials
2. **Regular Updates**: Refresh testimonials periodically
3. **Permission**: Always get client permission before publishing
4. **Diversity**: Include testimonials from various client types
5. **Specificity**: Include concrete results and metrics when possible

This system provides a professional, manageable way to showcase client success stories while maintaining the site's design integrity.
